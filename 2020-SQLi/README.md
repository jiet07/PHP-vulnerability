Abstract—Reported vulnerabilities have grown significantly
over the recent years, with SQL injection (SQLi) being one of the
most prominent, especially in web applications. For these, such
increase can be explained by the integration of multiple software
parts (e.g., various plugins and modules), often developed by
different organizations, composing thus web application variants.
Machine Learning has the potential to be a great ally on finding
vulnerabilities, aiding experts by reducing the search space or
even by classifying programs on their own. However, previous
work usually does not consider SQLi or utilizes techniques hard
to scale. Moreover, there is a clear gap in vulnerability detection
with machine learning for PHP, the most popular server-side
language for web applications. This paper presents a Deep
Learning model able to classify PHP slices as vulnerable (or
not) to SQLi. As slices can belong to any variant, we propose
the use of an intermediate language to represent the slices and
interpret them as text, resorting to well-studied Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques. Preliminary results of the use of
the model show that it can discover SQLi, helping programmers
and precluding attacks that would eventually cost a lot to repair.
