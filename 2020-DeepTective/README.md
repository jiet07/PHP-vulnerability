ABSTRACT
This paper presents DeepTective, a deep learning-based approach to
detect vulnerabilities in PHP source code. DeepTective implements
a novel hybrid technique that combines Gated Recurrent Units
and Graph Convolutional Networks to detect SQLi, XSS and OSCI
vulnerabilities leveraging both syntactic and semantic information.
Experimental results show that our model outperformed related
solutions on both synthetic and realistic datasets, and was able to
discover 4 novel vulnerabilities in established WordPress plugins.
