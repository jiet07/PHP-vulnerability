Abstract

The detection of software vulnerability requires critical attention during the development phase to make it secure 
and less vulnerable. Vulnerable software always invites hackers to perform malicious activities and disrupt the 
operation of the software, which leads to millions in financial losses to software companies. In order to reduce 
the losses, there are many reliable and effective vulnerability detection systems introduced by security com-
munities aiming to detect the software vulnerabilities as early as in the development or testing phases. To 
summarise the software vulnerability detection system, existing surveys discussed the conventional and data 
mining approaches. These approaches are widely used and mostly consist of traditional detection techniques. 
However, they lack discussion on the newly trending machine learning approaches, such as supervised learning 
and deep learning techniques. Furthermore, existing studies fail to discuss the growing research interest in the 
software vulnerability detection community throughout the years. With more discussion on this, we can predict 
and focus on what are the research problems in software vulnerability detection that need to be urgently 
addressed. Aiming to reduce these gaps, this paper presents the research interestsâ€™ taxonomy in software 
vulnerability detection, such as methods, detection, features, code and dataset. The research interest categories 
exhibit current trends in software vulnerability detection. The analysis shows that there is considerable interest 
in addressing methods and detection problems, while only a few are interested in code and dataset problems. 
This indicates that there is still much work to be done in terms of code and dataset problems in the future. 
Furthermore, this paper extends the machine learning approaches taxonomy, which is used to detect the software 
vulnerabilities, like supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, ensemble learning and deep learning. Based 
on the analysis, supervised learning and deep learning approaches are trending in the software vulnerability 
detection community as these techniques are able to detect vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, SQL injection 
and cross-site scripting effectively with a significant detection performance, up to 95% of F1 score. Finally, this 
paper concludes with several discussions on potential future work in software vulnerability detection in terms of 
datasets, multi-vulnerabilities detection, transfer learning and real-world applications.
